# Rust and WebAssembly

I've been yelling at clouds for some time about how Rust is  just another trend. In many conversations I've claimed that Rust will fade into  obscurity like most other niche programming  languages. But here I am learning it and reading [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). 

Until now, I've focused primarily in PHP, C#/ASP.NET,  and JavaScript + Node.js for WebApp development. For my side projects, I've developed a beginner level understanding of C++ embedded programming mainly through Arduino builds. 

Last year, I chose C++ instead of Rust because C++ is a boring, mature language, that is widely embraced by organizations.

Unfortunately, C++  feels archaic compared to other languages. Debugging C++ is a chore. And it feels downright dangerous writing it. This could be because I'm a hobbyist when it comes to embedded  programming. I haven't had any mentors and have been working for the most part in a vacuum.

I haven't seen C++ in production, like I have with my primary web languages. I'm sure there's something I could learn from studying the process of refactoring C++ along with the engineering lifecycle of applications running C++. Aside from this, it's hard to rationalize spending my time in a language that I don't enjoy, especially if it's for a hobby. I'm beginner level in C++ and can't justify a reason to become an expert. Learning Rust may provide a catalyst for learning C++, as they deal with many of the same concepts. Time will tell. 

Outside of my distaste for C++, there are a few reasons I'm learning Rust:
 
- The language is young and it's possible to make a difference as a solo developer in the future of the language.
- The community is welcoming and friendly, a refreshing sign in the open source space.
- I support Mozilla's mission as they are a driving force toward a safe, privacy-focused web, and the catalyst for Rust. 
- [WASM](http://webassembly.org)  is a leading competitor to JavaScript in the web browser, and may  change the game as more browsers adopt the standards. Rust compiles down  into WebAssembly, so it is possible to run Rust in the browser instead  of JavaScript.
- Rust feels more mature than C++. Rust is memory safe, has a  built-in static analyzer, and is generally faster to refactor and iron out bugs.

I'm learning Rust as a hobbyist for the sake of enjoyment. In Rust, I will be exploring concepts for the sake of exploring concepts. I'd like to make a couple fun projects to learn programming concepts that I would not otherwise learn through web programming. For the time being, I don't aim to build Rust into any production environment. That is what my primary web languages and frameworks are for.

In a few years, I may reconsider this if Rust becomes more widely embraced. There are plenty of organizations already using it in production: Microsoft, Mozilla, Dropbox, Yelp. For the time being, it is quite niche, but a welcoming place to set up shop as a hobbyist. If the future of Rust pans out, it will be an open source alternative to JavaScript and C++ that developers enjoy using. This is a future I support and will dedicate time to creating, even if that future may not come to fruition.
