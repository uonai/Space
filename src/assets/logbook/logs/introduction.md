# What and Why?

What is this? A logbook. To document life, ideas, and to write on the processes I'm working out. I'm trying to become a better programmer, a more open thinker, a bit more environmentally conscious, and more open in general. This logbook will contain somewhat random updates, tiny beams to the outside world when I feel comfortable writing them.

I like the mantra "strong opinions, loosely held", as it provides a much needed framework for personal growth. My opinions change often, and keep in mind that just because I've written it here, doesn't mean I still believe it to be true.

I tend to get theoretical, and writing is a way that I can boil down theory into actual real pragmatic solutions. If this logbook ends up as theory, then I'm doing it wrong. 

I aim to have fun more than anything, mostly because that is what I'm the worst at doing. 

The logbook will not be chasing big ideas, or a publishing spot for narcissistic manifestos. This is my umpteenth blog and I've spent so much time thinking about "big ideas" that it's really time to take a break. I'm finding that smaller ideas are much more fun to solve. I'd rather not spend life waldenponding the "big ideas": the hunt for meaning, truth, etc. Those would have been figured out long ago if they were in any way solvable. 

There are plenty of smaller ideas to find and work on, particularly in software, and this is my expertise at this point, for better or worse, so I'll be focusing my efforts there.

I like to write daily about the things I think about daily, in order to both remember these ideas and create a lasting structure to them that I can later think on. Some of these will writings will end up as logs in the logbook -- most will not.

My current focus as a software developer is JavaScript and the Microsoft Ecosystem: C#/ASP.NET, Azure Cloud, SQL Server, and CosmosDB. As a hobbyist I am learning C++ in order to build out Riverstone, a solar powered environmental sensor array in my home.
