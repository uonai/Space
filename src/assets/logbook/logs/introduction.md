# What and Why?

Welcome to my logbook. Here I'll be writing on life, ideas, and processes that I find interesting. I'm trying to become a better programmer, an open thinker, better educated on environmental conservation, and more generally focused on developing expertise around my odd, niche interests. This logbook will contain somewhat random updates, tiny beams of light to the outside world whenever I have the time and comfort to write them.

I like the mantra "strong opinions, loosely held," as it provides a much needed framework for valuing your own views, along with the views of others. My opinions change with frequency, so keep in mind that just because I've written it here, doesn't mean that I still believe it to be true.

I tend to get theoretical, and I use writing as a tool to boil down theory into real pragmatic solutions. If this logbook ends up as theory for the sake of theory, then I'm doing it wrong.  

The logbook will not be chasing big ideas, it will not be a publishing spot for narcissistic manifestos, and most of all it will not be a place where I explore cultural or political commentary. This is my umpteenth blog and I've spent so much time thinking about "big ideas" that it's really time to take a break. I'm finding that smaller ideas are much more fun to solve. The hunt for meaning, morality, truth, etc. would have been figured out long ago if they were in any way solvable. 

There are plenty of smaller ideas that I'm beginning to identify that I can work on in my own lifetime, particularly in software, and with software being my expertise at this point, then for better or worse I'll be focusing my efforts there.

I like to write daily about the things I think about daily, in order to both remember these ideas and create a lasting structure to them that I can later think on. Some of these will writings will end up as logs in the logbook -- most of these writings will not end up here.

## Focus

My current focus as a software developer is JavaScript and the Microsoft Ecosystem: C#/ASP.NET, Azure Cloud, SQL Server, and CosmosDB. As a hobbyist I am learning C++ in order to build out Riverstone, a solar powered environmental sensor array in my home. Most of writing will be related to this in some way. At time I may write about design, but I'm not qualified in any way to write about design, so take as you will. 

I have written on [Medium](https://medium.com/@colinmccaleb) in the past, and my [Jekyll Blog](https://github.com/uonai/Uonai/tree/master/_posts) but I will be moving all of my writing going forward to this logbook. 

## Source

All of this logbook is part of my Uonai.space Core Angular app that I am (slowly) adding features to. The source code for this app can be found [here](https://github.com/uonai/Space).

## Onward

Thank you for reading, and I hope you come back!
