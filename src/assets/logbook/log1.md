## [Introduction](/logbook/logs/introduction)
This is a logbook. To document life, ideas, and to write on the processes I'm working out. I'm trying to become a better programmer, a more open thinker, a bit more environmentally conscious, and more open in general. This logbook will contain somewhat random updates, tiny beams of light to the outside world whenever I have the time and comfort to write them.
